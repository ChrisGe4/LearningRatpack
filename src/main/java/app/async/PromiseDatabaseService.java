        It is important to note that when adapting asynchronous libraries that have their own threading and execution model,
        once the data from their thread of execution fulfills the promise, the processing is returned to the originating thread of
        execution in Ratpackâ€™s execution model. While this will eventually make downstream processing of multiple data objects faster lower in the execution chain, you will likely experience a CPU context switch when moving data between threads
